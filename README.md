# Simple
Simple is a lightweight and simple game framework much like Love2d. Simple is made in C++ with OpenGL and has Lua as scripting language. The idea behind Simple is to have a small game framework which has all the features that you would expect from a game framework in a cross platform manner. Right now Simple is under heavy work.
## List of _big_ features planned:
+ Lua - done
+ Emscripten (almost done)
+ Android
